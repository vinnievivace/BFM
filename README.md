###  Overview

- The Fluflet generation introduces a new layer of value to the original **Fluf collection (10,000 supply: 7,000 male / 3,000 female)**. By tightly controlling breeding and evolution, Fluflets remain rare and desirable — while reinforcing the importance of parent Flufs.

  

  #### **Breeding Mechanics**

  - Fluflets are created only through **one male + one female Fluf** pairing.
  - Each Fluf (or pair) has a **strict lifetime limit** on how many Fluflets they can produce (e.g., 1–2 total).
  - Breeding occurs only during **limited seasonal windows**, ensuring urgency and controlling supply.
  - Not all eligible pairs are guaranteed a Fluflet each season — breeding may require access passes or a lottery mechanic, keeping outcomes scarce.

  

  #### Village Multiplier

  - A Fluflet’s growth and rarity potential are amplified by the **number of Flufs in the holder’s wallet** (the “village”).
  - Larger villages raise stronger Fluflets, unlocking faster evolution, rarer traits, and occasional mutations.
  - The multiplier caps at **7 pairs (14 Flufs)**. Beyond this, holders can still breed more Fluflets, but do not gain further evolutionary advantage — preventing whales from dominating supply.

  #### **Scarcity Controls**

  - **Max Supply Cap**: The total number of Fluflets will be strictly limited (e.g., no more than 5,000). Once reached, no more can be created.
  - **Care Requirement**: Fluflets must be nurtured post-mint to mature. Neglected Fluflets risk devolving into common or “dust bunny” forms, creating a natural burn mechanism.
  - **Trait Rarity**: Some advanced traits only emerge when rare Flufs are paired, reinforcing the premium value of uncommon parent traits.

  

  #### **Investor Value Proposition**

  - **Parent Value Increase**: Fluf pairs (especially female Flufs) become essential for access to the next generation, driving up their market value.
  - **Retention & Upside**: Holders are incentivized to accumulate and hold more Flufs to maximize breeding and evolution potential.
  - **Balanced Economics**: The capped multiplier prevents whales from capturing outsized share while still rewarding larger collectors.
  - **Long-Term Scarcity**: With tightly controlled supply, Fluflets remain rare, ensuring they are accretive to parent value rather than dilutive.
