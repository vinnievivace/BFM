###  Overview

The introduction of **Fluflets** establishes a new generational NFT layer designed to increase the long-term value of the original **Fluf collection (10,000 supply: 7,000 male / 3,000 female)**.

#### **Breeding Mechanics**

- Breeding requires **one male and one female Fluf**.
- Each pair can produce a limited number of offspring, ensuring scarcity and preserving parent value.
- Fluflets inherit a combination of traits from parents, with the potential for rare mutations.

#### **Village Multiplier**

- A Fluflet’s growth and rarity potential are influenced not only by its parents, but also by the **number of Flufs in the holder’s wallet** (“the village”).
- Larger villages raise stronger Fluflets: holding multiple pairs increases the chance of superior evolution and rarer outcomes.
- This mechanic directly incentivizes holding more Flufs, increasing floor value and strengthening parent desirability.

#### **Whale Control**

- To prevent extreme concentration of advantage, the multiplier effect caps at **7 pairs (14 Flufs)**.
- Beyond this threshold, additional Flufs still enable more breeding cycles but do not further magnify growth/evolution speed.
- This ensures balanced upside across holders, while still rewarding larger, committed collectors.

#### **Investor Value Proposition**

- **Parent Value Increase**: Owning male/female pairs becomes essential, driving demand for balanced holdings.
- **Retention Mechanism**: Holders are incentivized to keep and grow their villages rather than flipping individual Flufs.
- **Generational Expansion**: Fluflets create new scarcity without diluting parent value, embedding long-term sustainability into the ecosystem.
